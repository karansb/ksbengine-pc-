to load 3d models:
1. load it in maya
2. export as .obj from maya (make sure that triangulate faces is ticked)
3. put exported .obj in 3d objects obj folder
4. load it using the obj loader class 
5. render it in main game loop

note: after pulling from github, the first three steps has to be done for each object
(although it is already in the folder)
